--TWIN CHANNEL OPERATIONS

### **Primary Component: Twin Channel**

- **Function:** The Twin Channel acts as an intermediary transfer device. Its core function is to receive a decelerated bar from one of the two tail braker lines and, through a 360-degree rotational motion of a flap, discharge the bar onto a specific starting notch of the cooling bed. It alternates between its two channels to handle the continuous flow of bars. The system is designed to place bars gently and has a self-monitoring function to detect potential jams (cobbles).
- **Input:** A decelerated steel bar moving at a slow, residual speed (`VFREN`) from the tail braker. A "tail clear" signal from the tail braker logic, which initiates the twin channel's operating cycle after a set time delay.
- **Output:** A stationary hot bar deposited onto the fixed rake of the cooling bed.
- **Sensors:** The primary control sensor is the **Pulse Generator (Encoder)** (e.g., B001, B008) on the gearbox, which precisely tracks the 360Â° position of the discharging flap. **Hot Metal Detectors (HMDs)** (e.g., B101, B102) at the exit serve as a critical safety system to detect cobbles. Various motor protection sensors (KLIXONS, thermostats, etc.) ensure the health of the drive motors.

### **Sequence of Operations for Twin Channel Discharge**

**Step 1: Cycle Initiation and Bar Tracking**

- **Description:** The twin channel is in its "home" or rest position. The cycle begins after it receives a signal that the tail of the previous bar has left the tail braker. The system then waits for a calculated time delay, allowing the new bar to slide completely into the twin channel's stationary receiving cavity.
- **Material Status:** The bar, moving at a slow speed (`VFREN`), slides into and comes to rest within the twin channel's U-shaped cavity.
- **Component Actions & Control Signals:**
    - **Sensors:** The system relies on the tail detection signal from the upstream tail braker logic to start its internal timer. The **Pulse Generator (Encoder)** confirms the flap is in its rest position.
    - **Control Logic:** After the time delay (allowing the bar to settle), the PLC initiates the `START BAR TRACKING DURING FREE DECELERATION` sequence. This prepares the system for the discharge motion. The motor drive is enabled but the motor is not yet moving.

**Step 2: High-Torque Discharge Rotation**

- **Description:** The main drive motor engages, beginning the 360-degree rotation of the discharging flap. The flap lifts the bar up and out of the receiving channel and begins moving it over the cooling bed. This initial phase requires high torque to overcome the inertia of the bar and the mechanism.
- **Material Status:** The stationary bar is lifted and begins to travel in an arc over the cooling bed's entry point.
- **Component Actions & Control Signals:**
    - **Control Logic:** The PLC sends the `START CYCLE` command to the motor drive.
    - **Motor:** The drive applies a high torque limit to the motor, causing it to accelerate and rotate the flap.
    - **Sensors:** The **Pulse Generator (Encoder)** continuously sends position data back to the PLC, which tracks the flap's progress through its rotation.

**Step 3: Low-Torque Bar Placement**

- **Description:** As the rotating flap passes its apex and begins to lower the bar towards the cooling bed, the control system reduces the motor's torque. This ensures a gentle placement of the bar onto the cooling bed's fixed rake, preventing a hard impact that could damage the bar or the equipment.
- **Material Status:** The bar is gently placed onto the first notch of the fixed rake of the cooling bed and becomes stationary.
- **Component Actions & Control Signals:**
    - **Sensors:** The **Pulse Generator (Encoder)** signals that the flap has reached the "CLOSING PHASE" of its rotation.
    - **Control Logic:** The PLC commands the motor drive to switch to a low torque limit (e.g., 20-25% of nominal).
    - **Motor:** The motor continues to rotate the flap at a controlled, low power until the bar is fully discharged.

**Step 4: Cycle Completion and Reset**

- **Description:** The flap, now empty, completes its 360-degree rotation and returns to its home position, ready to receive the next bar from the alternate tail braker line.
- **Material Status:** The bar is now stationary on the cooling bed, and the twin channel is clear.
- **Component Actions & Control Signals:**
    - **Sensors:** The **Pulse Generator (Encoder)** signals that the flap has reached its 360-degree "CYCLE END" position.
    - **Control Logic:** The PLC commands the motor speed to zero and stops the drive. The twin channel system is now ready for its next cycle.

### **Primary Component: Cooling Bed**

- **Function:** The Cooling Bed's function begins the moment a bar is placed on its fixed rake. It operates in a step-by-step cycle to advance the entire layer of bars across the bed for cooling. The operation is triggered not by the bar itself, but by its own internal position sensors and timers.
- **Input:** A hot steel bar from the Twin Channel. A "bar present" status from its internal logic.
- **Output:** The entire layer of bars on the bed is moved forward by one notch (pitch).
- **Sensors:** The operation is governed by **Position Sensors (S101-S112)** that detect the rake's slow-down and home positions. The **Bar Presence Sensor (S001)** at the exit detects when the bed is full.

### **Sequence of Operations for Cooling Bed Reception and First Step**

**Step 1: Cycle Start and Brake Release**

- **Description:** The cooling bed is stationary with its movable rake at the home position. The system has registered that the twin channel has discharged a bar onto its aprons. After a pre-set delay time (set in the OWS to allow for the twin channel to clear), the cooling bed begins its own cycle. The first action is to release the mechanical holding brake.
- **Material Status:** The new bar is stationary on the first notch of the cooling bed.
- **Component Actions & Control Signals:**
    - **Sensors:** The `HOME POSITION` sensor (S102/S112) confirms the rake is in the correct start position. `MATERIAL PRESENCE ON APRONS AREA` is a permissive condition.
    - **Control Logic:** After the delay timer elapses, the PLC sends the "Open" command to the standing brake solenoid.
    - **Shoe Brake:** The solenoid is energized, releasing the mechanical brake from the drive shaft.

**Step 2: Rake Advance Cycle**

- **Description:** The main drive motors engage, causing the movable rake to perform one full eccentric cycle. It lifts all the bars on the bed, advances them one notch, lowers them onto the fixed rake, and returns to its start position under the bars.
- **Material Status:** The new bar (and all others on the bed) is lifted and moved one step forward.
- **Component Actions & Control Signals:**
    - **Motor:** The motor accelerates to its pre-set "Work Speed."
    - **Sensors:** As the rake approaches the end of its cycle, the **Slow Down Speed Position Detection** sensor (S101/S111) is triggered.
    - **Control Logic:** In response to the slow-down sensor, the PLC commands the motor drive to decelerate to its "Slow Speed."
    - **Sensors:** The rake continues at slow speed until the **Home Position** sensor (S102/S112) is triggered.

**Step 3: Cycle Completion and Brake Engage**

- **Description:** The rake has completed its 360-degree eccentric motion and is back at its home position. The drive motor stops, and the mechanical brake is engaged to securely hold the system in place until the next cycle is required.
- **Material Status:** The new bar is now stationary one notch further into the cooling bed.
- **Component Actions & Control Signals:**
    - **Control Logic:** Upon receiving the signal from the Home Position sensor, the PLC commands the motor speed to zero. It then sends the "Close" command (de-energizes the solenoid) to the standing brake.
    - **Shoe Brake:** The brake engages, locking the drive shaft. The cooling bed is now stationary and ready for the next discharge from the twin channel.

### B. Tail Braker Area

The Tail Braker's function is to receive the bar from the dividing shear, pull it if necessary, and then brake its speed in a controlled manner before it is discharged into the Twin Channel. This ensures a smooth and safe transfer to the cooling bed.

**1. Tail Braker Components:**

*   **Pinch Roller System:**
    *   **Upper Roller:** Applies downward pressure onto the bar to assist in braking.
    *   **Lower Roller:** Supports the bar from underneath and provides grip for controlled deceleration.
    *   **Roller Bearing:** Enables smooth rotation of the pinch rollers with reduced friction.
    *   **Thrust Bearing:** Manages axial loads on the rollers, ensuring stability during operation.
*   **Pneumatic System:**
    *   **Pneumatic Cylinder:** Actuates the pinch rolls (likely the upper roller) to apply or release braking force, using compressed air.
    *   **Pneumatic Cylinder Rod:** Transmits the force from the pneumatic cylinder to the pinch roll mechanism.
    *   **Air Compressor:** (Usually a central plant system) Supplies the compressed air needed for the pneumatic system.
    *   **Pneumatic Cylinder Seals:** Maintain air pressure within the cylinder for effective actuation.
*   **Braking Disc System:** (If applicable, some tail brakers might rely solely on motor braking and pinch roller pressure)
    *   **Braking Disc:** A disc that rotates with the roller/drive; brake pads engage it to create friction.
    *   **Brake Pads:** Friction material pressed against the braking disc to slow down rotation.
    *   **Disc Housing:** Protects the braking disc and pad assembly.
    *   **Cooling Fan:** Dissipates heat generated during braking.
*   **Guide Roller System:**
    *   **Guide Rollers:** Help maintain the alignment of the bar as it passes through the tail braker.
    *   **Roller Shaft:** Axle supporting the guide rollers.
    *   **Support Bracket:** Mounts and holds the guide rollers in position.
*   **Control and Monitoring System:**
    *   **Control Unit:** (Part of the overall PLC/automation system) Executes the logic for braking sequences and speed control.
    *   **Safety Interlocks:** Ensure safe operation by preventing actions under unsafe conditions.
    *   **Solenoid Valves:** Electrically actuated valves controlling the flow of pneumatic air or hydraulic fluid for pinch roll actuation and pressure control.
*   **Driver System:**
    *   **Drive Motor:** Powers the pinch rolls, enabling them to pull the bar and provide controlled braking torque.
    *   **Speed Reducer (Gearbox):** Adjusts the motor's speed and torque to suitable levels for the pinch roll operation.
*   **Cooling System (for hydraulics/lubrication):**
    *   **Oil Cooler:** A heat exchanger to remove excess heat from hydraulic or lubrication oil, maintaining optimal operating temperatures.
    *   **Cooling Fan:** Assists the oil cooler by providing airflow for heat dissipation.
*   **Gear Box:**
    *   **Gears:** Transmit power and modify speed/torque from the motor to the pinch rollers.
    *   **Bearings:** Reduce friction within the gearbox for smooth operation of shafts and gears.
    *   **Shaft:** Transmits rotational motion within the gearbox.
*   **Lubrication Fluid System:**
    *   **Oil Pump:** Circulates lubrication fluid to bearings, gears, and potentially the cooler and filter.
    *   **Lubrication Fluid Cooler:** Cools the lubrication fluid to maintain its properties.
    *   **Lubricating Fluid:** Oil or grease used to reduce friction and wear in moving parts.
    *   **Pressure Regulator:** Maintains the correct pressure in the lubrication system.
    *   **Oil Filter:** Removes contaminants from the lubrication fluid to protect components.

--TAIL BRAKER OPERATIONS:

The two primary solenoid valves controlling the tail braker's upper roll are:

- **Standard Pressure Solenoid:** Actuated by the `UPPER ROLLER 1A/1B COMMAND - CLOSURE` signal (Electric Code **Y001/Y002**). This valve provides the standard clamping force used to grip and pull the bar at line speed.
- **High-Pressure Solenoid:** Actuated by the `UPPER ROLLER 1A/1B HIGH PRESSURE COMMAND - CLOSURE` signal (Electric Code **Y011/Y012**). This is an *additional* solenoid valve that, when activated along with the standard one, significantly increases the clamping force on the bar. This high pressure is essential for the braking phase to decelerate the bar without slippage.

### **Sequence of Operations for Tail Braking**

The operation can be broken down into the following distinct steps, beginning as the cut bar exits the upstream dividing shear and approaches the tail braker.

---

### **Step 1: Awaiting and Engaging the Bar (Pulling Phase)**

- **Description:** The tail braker is in a ready state, waiting for the front end of the bar. The motors are already running at a slight overspeed relative to the main rolling line speed to ensure there is a gentle pulling tension on the bar as soon as it is gripped. This prevents buckling and keeps the bar straight.
- **Material Status:** The bar is traveling at a constant rolling speed (`VLAM`) and is approaching the tail braker entrance.
- **Component Actions & Control Signals:**
    - **Sensors:** The **Material Presence Sensor** (e.g., B001) at the tail braker inlet is monitoring for the hot bar.
    - **Control Logic:** Upon receiving the "bar present" signal from the sensor, the PLC issues the command to close the roll.
    - **Solenoid Valves:** The standard pressure solenoid is energized (signal **Y001** for line 1A is activated). The high-pressure solenoid (**Y011**) remains de-energized.
    - **Rolls:** The pneumatic cylinder extends, closing the upper roll onto the bar with standard clamping force.
    - **Motor:** The motor continues to run at its pre-set overspeed, now gripping the bar and actively pulling it through the unit. The drive's torque limit is at a standard, lower setting sufficient for pulling.

---

### **Step 2: Initiating the Braking Cycle (Braking Phase)**

- **Description:** This critical phase begins after the upstream dividing shear has made its final cut and the system has calculated that the tail end of the bar has reached the precise starting point for deceleration. The goal is to slow the bar from its high rolling speed down to a slow, controlled discharge speed.
- **Material Status:** The bar is initially still moving at rolling speed (`VLAM`). As this step proceeds, its speed rapidly decreases along a defined deceleration ramp (`KDEC`).
- **Component Actions & Control Signals:**
    - **Sensors:** There is no direct sensor for this trigger. The PLC uses the "bar tail" signal from an upstream HMD and its knowledge of the bar speed to calculate the exact moment the tail reaches the "Start Brake Position."
    - **Control Logic:** Once the calculated start-brake position is reached, the PLC initiates the braking sequence.
    - **Solenoid Valves:** The **High-Pressure Solenoid** is energized (signal **Y011** is activated). This happens *in addition* to the already-energized standard pressure solenoid (Y001). The combination of both valves applies maximum clamping force to the bar.
    - **Motor:** The motor drive receives a new speed reference, commanding it to ramp down from `VLAM` to the final `VFREN`. The motor's torque limit is increased to its maximum to provide the necessary braking force to decelerate the bar's mass.
    - **Rolls:** The upper roll is now clamping the bar with maximum force, allowing the motor to brake the bar effectively without slippage.

---

### **Step 3: Discharging and Releasing the Bar**

- **Description:** The bar has been successfully decelerated to its target residual speed (`VFREN`) and the tail end of the bar has passed completely through the tail braker's rolls. The system must now release the bar to allow it to travel into the twin channel.
- **Material Status:** The bar is now moving at the slow, constant discharge speed (`VFREN`) and exits the tail braker, entering the twin channel.
- **Component Actions & Control Signals:**
    - **Sensors:** The system tracks the bar's position via the motor encoder. The "tail bar leaves the tail braker" event is calculated based on the known bar length and the distance traveled.
    - **Control Logic:** The PLC issues the command to open the rolls.
    - **Solenoid Valves:** Both the standard pressure (**Y001**) and high-pressure (**Y011**) solenoid valves are de-energized.
    - **Rolls:** The pneumatic cylinder retracts due to the spring return, opening the upper roll and releasing the bar.
    - **Motor:** The motor's task is complete for this bar.

---

### **Step 4: Resetting for the Next Cycle**

- **Description:** After the bar is released, the tail braker must immediately reset itself to be ready for the next bar from the same line.
- **Material Status:** The previous bar has cleared the unit. The system is awaiting the next bar.
- **Component Actions & Control Signals:**
    - **Control Logic:** The PLC commands the motor back to its initial ready state.
    - **Motor:** The motor drive receives a command to speed back up to its initial "overspeed and torque limit" state, running slightly faster than the main line in anticipation of the next bar.
    - **Rolls:** The rolls remain open.
    - **Solenoid Valves:** Both solenoids remain de-energized until the next bar is detected, at which point the cycle repeats from Step 1.

The description information provides background. 

<FAILURE MODE DESCRIPTION>
### **Tail Braker Failure Modes**

### **Failure to Grip Bar**

- **Cause:** The upper roll fails to close on the incoming bar. This can be caused by a mechanical jam of the roll mechanism, failure of the pneumatic cylinder, a stuck or failed standard pressure solenoid valve, or a loss of compressed air.
- **Component:** Upper Roll, Pneumatic Cylinder, Standard Pressure Solenoid Valve (Y001/Y002).
- **Effect:** The bar travels through the tail braker at full rolling speed (`VLAM`) without being engaged. The system cannot perform its pulling or braking function. This will cause the bar to arrive at the twin channel un-braked and much earlier than expected, leading to a high-speed impact and a likely cobble.
- **Sensors:**
    - **Rolling Closing Pressure Sensor (B011/B012):** This is the most direct detector. The sensor will not register the expected pressure rise when the "close" command is given, indicating the roll did not successfully clamp the bar.
    - **Motor Drive Current/Torque:** The drive will not register the expected small increase in torque associated with gripping and pulling the bar.
    - **Downstream Material Presence Sensor (at Twin Channel):** The PLC's tracking system will detect the bar arriving at the next zone far sooner than its calculated time, indicating a major process discrepancy.

### **Bar Slippage During Braking**

- **Cause:** Insufficient clamping force is applied during the high-speed braking phase, causing the rolls to slip against the surface of the bar. This can be caused by the failure of the additional high-pressure solenoid valve to actuate, low system air pressure, or excessively worn/contaminated roll surfaces.
- **Component:** Upper/Lower Rolls, High-Pressure Solenoid Valve (Y011/Y012).
- **Effect:** The motor decelerates as commanded, but because the rolls are slipping, the bar does not slow down. The bar will exit the tail braker at a speed significantly higher than the intended `VFREN`, causing a severe impact with the twin channel and likely resulting in equipment damage or a major cobble.
- **Sensors:**
    - **Motor Encoder (e.g., M001-B001):** The encoder will report to the PLC that the motor is decelerating correctly. However, the system's material tracking (using upstream and downstream HMDs) will show that the bar's actual velocity is not decreasing. This conflict between motor speed and material speed is a clear indicator of slippage.
    - **High-Pressure Command vs. Actual Pressure:** While not explicitly listed as a separate sensor, a diagnostic could compare the "High Pressure Command ON" state with the `Rolling Closing Pressure Sensor` reading. If the pressure does not increase to the high-pressure level, it indicates this failure.

### **Motor/Drive Failure (Stall)**

- **Cause:** The drive motor stops rotating unexpectedly during the cycle due to an internal electrical/mechanical fault, a DC drive trip (e.g., overcurrent), or a seizure in the gearbox.
- **Component:** DC Motor (M001/M002), DC Drive, Gearbox.
- **Effect:** The bar comes to an abrupt halt within the tail braker. This immediately stops the line, causing an upstream material backup and cobble. Production is stopped until the fault is cleared.
- **Sensors:**
    - **DC Drive Fault Signal:** The drive itself is the primary source of detection, reporting a specific fault (e.g., overcurrent, field loss) to the PLC.
    - **Motor Encoder (M001-B001):** Will report zero or no change in speed when a speed is commanded, indicating a stall.
    - **Armature/Field KLIXONS (M001-S902 to S905):** These thermal switches will trip if the stall condition leads to a rapid temperature rise in the motor windings, providing a hardwired fault signal.

### **Failure to Release Bar**

- **Cause:** The upper roll fails to retract after the braking cycle is complete. This could be due to a mechanically jammed cylinder, a solenoid valve (Y001/Y002) that is stuck in the energized position, or a failure in the PLC to send the "open" command.
- **Component:** Upper Roll, Pneumatic Cylinder, Standard Pressure Solenoid Valve.
- **Effect:** The tail braker holds the bar captive. The downstream twin channel cannot receive the bar, and the tail braker motor, attempting to reset to its ready-state overspeed, will be working against a stationary load. This will cause a motor overload/stall and halt the line.
- **Sensors:**
    - **Motor Drive Torque/Current:** The drive will register a massive torque spike as it tries to accelerate while the bar is still clamped.
    - **Motor Encoder (M001-B001):** Will show that the motor is not accelerating as expected, indicating it is stalled.
    - **Downstream HMDs:** The twin channel and cooling bed will not detect the arrival of the bar, leading to a timeout alarm in the material tracking logic.

### **Mechanical Overspeed (Runaway)**

- **Cause:** A critical failure in the DC drive's control logic causes it to apply maximum voltage to the motor, leading to uncontrolled acceleration far beyond the operational setpoints.
- **Component:** DC Drive, DC Motor.
- **Effect:** Catastrophic failure. The motor and gearbox can be destroyed by the excessive rotational forces. The bar could be ejected from the machine at extremely high and unpredictable speeds, posing a severe safety hazard.
- **Sensors:**
    - **Overspeed SWITCH (M001-S901):** This is the most critical safety sensor for this event. It is a mechanical, independent switch that will physically trip when a pre-set rotational speed is exceeded, triggering a hardwired emergency stop of the system.
    - **Motor Encoder (M001-B001):** Will report a speed to the PLC that is drastically higher than the commanded speed reference, which should trigger a secondary software-based emergency stop.

### **Loss of Lubrication**

- **Cause:** Failure of the lubrication system pump, a blocked line, or depletion of lubrication oil.
- **Component:** Gearbox, Bearings, Lubrication System.
- **Effect:** This is a latent failure. There is no immediate effect, but continued operation without lubrication will lead to rapid wear, overheating, and eventual seizure of the gearbox or bearings, which will then manifest as a "Motor/Drive Failure (Stall)".
- **Sensors:**
    - **Oil Lubrication Flow Switch (S051/S052):** This sensor directly monitors the flow of lubricant. A loss of flow will trigger a low-priority alarm, alerting operators to the condition before catastrophic damage occurs, allowing for a planned stop.


### **Primary Component: Twin Channel**

### **Flap Rotation Stall / Mechanical Jam**

- **Cause:** The discharging flap is physically blocked from completing its 360-degree rotation. This could be caused by a seized gearbox, a failed AC motor, or a bar that was not properly seated in the channel and becomes wedged during the lifting motion.
- **Component:** Discharging Flap, AC Motors (M001-M008), Gearbox.
- **Effect:** The bar transfer is halted mid-cycle. The affected channel is blocked, preventing any further bars from being processed on that line. This leads to a line stoppage and requires manual intervention to clear the jam. There is a risk of mechanical damage to the drive train or flap structure.
- **Sensors:**
    - **Motor Drive Fault Signal:** The AC drive is the primary detector. It will register an overcurrent or over-torque condition as the motor tries to push against the jam and will send a fault signal to the PLC.
    - **Pulse Generator (Encoder) (B001, B008):** The PLC will detect that the encoder's position value is not changing despite an active motor command. This discrepancy will trigger a "positioning timeout" or "movement error" alarm.
    - **Motor Armature KLIXONS (e.g., M001-S902/S903):** If the stall condition persists and causes the motor to overheat, these thermal switches will trip, providing a hardwired fault signal.

### **Flap Positioning Error (Overshoot/Undershoot)**

- **Cause:** The discharging flap fails to stop at its correct "home" rest position after a cycle. This is almost always caused by a failure of the feedback system, such as a faulty or slipping Pulse Generator (Encoder), or a problem with the drive's braking logic.
- **Component:** Pulse Generator (Encoder) (B001, B008), AC Drive.
- **Effect:** The twin channel is not in the correct position to safely receive the next bar from the tail braker. The control system's interlocks will prevent the next cycle from starting because the "at home" permissive is not met. This results in a line stoppage until the position can be re-homed or the faulty component is repaired.
- **Sensors:**
    - **Pulse Generator (Encoder) (B001, B008):** This sensor is both a potential cause and the primary means of detection. The PLC logic compares the final encoder reading at the end of a cycle to the expected "home" value. If they do not match within a defined tolerance, a positioning fault alarm is generated.

### **Cobble Not Detected at Channel Exit**

- **Cause:** A bar jams at the exit of the twin channel (e.g., it was not braked correctly and hit the backstop), but the safety sensor designed to detect this fails. The sensor itself could be faulty, its lens obscured by steam or debris, or its signal connection to the PLC could be lost.
- **Component:** Hot Metal Detector (HMD) / Cobble Sensor (B101, B102).
- **Effect:** This is a critical failure. The system does not realize the channel is blocked. Consequently, it does not send a "scrap cut" signal to the upstream shear. The next bar is fed from the tail braker into the already-jammed channel, resulting in a severe cobble, a high risk of significant equipment damage, and extended downtime.
- **Sensors:**
    - This is a failure *of* the primary sensor (**HMD - B101/B102**). The secondary, indirect detection would be the **Flap Rotation Stall** failure mode described above. When the twin channel attempts to cycle with the jammed bar, the motor will stall, and the motor drive and encoder will detect the jam. However, this secondary detection happens too late to prevent the initial collision.

---

### **Primary Component: Cooling Bed**

### **Failure to Advance (Rake Does Not Cycle)**

- **Cause:** The movable rake fails to start its step-by-step advance cycle after a bar is discharged onto it. This can be caused by a failure of the main drive motor, a trip/fault in the AC drive, or, most commonly, the mechanical **Shoe Brake** failing to release its grip on the drive shaft.
- **Component:** AC Motors (M001, M002), Shoe Brake, AC Drive.
- **Effect:** The cooling bed remains stationary. The twin channels will continue to discharge bars onto the entry section, causing them to pile up. This quickly creates a major cobble at the cooling bed entry, halting production.
- **Sensors:**
    - **Motor Drive Fault Signal:** If the motor attempts to run against a locked brake, the drive will detect an immediate over-torque condition and fault.
    - **Position Sensors (S101-S112):** The PLC's cycle logic includes a timer. If the rake does not move and trigger the "slow down" and "stop" sensors within the expected time, a "cycle timeout" alarm is generated.

### **Rake Positioning Failure (Overshoot)**

- **Cause:** The movable rake does not stop at its precise home position after completing a cycle. This is typically caused by a failure of the **Stop Position Sensor** (it fails to detect the rake) or an issue with the motor/drive braking that allows it to coast past the stop point.
- **Component:** Stop Position Sensor (S102, S112), AC Drive.
- **Effect:** The rake stops in an incorrect position, meaning its notches are misaligned with the fixed rake. When the twin channel next discharges a bar, the bar can be dropped between the notches, causing a jam. The system will be unable to start a new cycle because the "at home" permissive is not met.
- **Sensors:**
    - **Stop Position Sensor (S102, S112):** The failure is detected by the PLC logic

--Carefully review the background information given between the tags <BACKGROUND_INFO> and </BACKGROUND_INFO>

--Background information contains specific information in sub sections. The sub sections are enclosed with in additional tags. The background information is organized as follows:

-Information about the entire Rolling Mill Facility is provided between the tags <FACILITY_INFO> and </FACILITY_INFO>. Provides overall information about the rolling mill facility.

-Information about the fault "cobble", causes, monitoring, prevention strategeis, sensors and tags that can detect are enclosed between the tags <COBBLE_INFO> and </COBBLE_INFO>.

-Cobble occurs in a sub area of the facility known as the Twin Channel Area. Detailed information about this area is provided between the tags <TWIN_CHANNEL_AREA_INFO> and </TWIN_CHANNEL_AREA_INFO>. Provides detailed information about the Twin Channel and associated Tail Braker areas.

-Sensor list for the twin channel and tail braker are provided between the tags <TWIN_CHANNEL_SENSORS> and </TWIN_CHANNEL_SENSORS> and <TAIL_BREAKER_SENSORS> and </TAIL_BREAKER_SENSORS> respectively.

-Failure modes of the twin channel and tail braker are provided between tags
<FAILURE_MODE_INFO> and </FAILURE_MODE_INFO>

-Based on background information, construct knowledge base required to analyze faults occurring in the system described. Focus on knowledge required to analyze incidents of
cobble.

--Carefully review the description of cobble event provided between the tags <EVENTS_HUMAN_NOTES> and </EVENTS_HUMAN_NOTES>

--Based on the cobble event described between the tags <EVENTS_HUMAN_NOTES> and </EVENTS_HUMAN_NOTES>, construct the following (based on background data, your knowledge):
-possible causes of the particular cobble event,
-components involved,
-failure modes, 
-failure mode should be extracted from FMEA table given between <TWIN_CHANNEL_FMEA> and </TWIN_CHANNEL_FMEA>
or <TAIL_BRAKER_FMEA> and </TAIL_BRAKER_FMEA>

-any recommendation for mitigating the cobble in the future,
-list of possible specific sesnors that may be used to investigate this particular cobble
-if multiple causes are inferred, create a list of specific sensors that can be used to detect each cause.
-use only specific sensors from the sensor list provided in the background information to create the list of sensors. The sensor
lise is provided between 
--the tags <TWIN_CHANNEL_SENSORS> and </TWIN_CHANNEL_SENSORS> and
--the tags <TAIL_BREAKER_SENSORS> and </TAIL_BREAKER_SENSORS>.
-DO NOT CREATE ANY NEW SENSORS. USE ONLY THE SENSORS PROVIDED IN THE BACKGROUND INFORMATION.

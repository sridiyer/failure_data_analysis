### **1. System-Level Summary**

- **The Tail Braker is the Epicenter of Failure:** A commanding majority of the recorded failures (**8 out of 10** unique events: 89, 95, 100, 115, 116, 135, 139, 140, 141, 145, 146, 164, 165) originate in the **Tail Braker**, not the Twin Channel. Failures in the Twin Channel are often the *symptom*, not the cause. The "Material Hit" alarms on the Twin Channel are frequently the final consequence of an upstream Tail Braker malfunction. **Strategic focus must be shifted to the proactive health of the Tail Braker systems.**
- **Mechanical Power Transmission is the Critical Weak Point:** The most frequent and recurring root cause across all failure groups is the failure of mechanical power transmission components within the Tail Braker drivetrain. This includes couplings, coupling keys, hub shafts, and gearbox internals. These account for nearly 70% of the analyzed incidents.
- **Lubrication Failures are Latent and Catastrophic:** Events **164** (seized bearing from a broken lube line) and **95** (gearbox failure from an oil seal leak) highlight that failures in the lubrication support system lead to catastrophic, seizure-type events. These are often preceded by detectable warning signs (like the rising torque in event 164) that are currently being missed.

### **2. The Two Definitive Failure Signatures of the Tail Braker**

For diagnostic and operational purposes, the vast majority of Tail Braker failures can be simplified into two distinct, opposing signatures:

1. **"Sudden Over-Torque" Signature (Stalls & Jams):**
    - **Description:** The motor torque and current spike to maximum levels while the speed drops to zero.
    - **Causes:** Bearing seizure (event 164), jammed/broken material (event 135), or other mechanical obstructions (events 89, 100).
    - **Symptom:** **Undershoot**. The bar stops abruptly in the line.
2. **"Sudden Loss of Torque" Signature (Decoupling & Slippage):**
    - **Description:** The motor torque and current drop to near-zero (no-load) levels, even while the motor is commanded to brake.
    - **Causes:** Broken coupling, key, or hub (events 115, 116, 139, 140, 141, 145, 165) or a gearbox lubrication failure preventing torque transmission (event 95).
    - **Symptom:** **Overshoot**. The bar is not braked and travels at high speed.

Recognizing these two patterns can drastically speed up root cause analysis on the mill floor.

### **3. Strategic Recommendations for Failure Prevention**

Based on these findings, the following multi-pronged strategy is recommended:

**A. Enhanced Maintenance Strategy (From Reactive to Proactive)**

1. **Targeted Drivetrain Inspections:** The corrective actions frequently mention "welding done" or "coupling changed." This is reactive. A proactive, scheduled inspection program is required, focusing on the identified weak points:
    - **Mandatory Checklist Item:** During every planned shutdown, conduct detailed inspections of all Tail Braker coupling bolts, keys, and hub integrity. This was a direct recommendation from event 145 and should be formally adopted.
    - **Non-Destructive Testing (NDT):** For critical welds and components like the muff couplings (events 115, 116), implement periodic dye penetrant or magnetic particle testing to find fatigue cracks before they lead to failure.
2. **Condition-Based Lubrication Management:**
    - **Upgrade Instrumentation:** The systemic oil temperature sensor is insufficient. Install **dedicated flow or pressure switches on the individual lubrication lines** feeding critical bearings, like the one that failed in event 164. This provides an immediate alarm upon a line break or blockage.
    - **Upgrade Materials:** Follow through on the recommendation from event 164 to replace vulnerable Carbon Steel (CS) lubrication lines with more durable Stainless Steel (SS) and shorten pipe lengths to reduce vibration fatigue.

**B. Operational & Procedural Improvements**

1. **Pre-Startup Verification:** Event 95 ("1ST PIECE OVERSHOOT AFTER MILL STOPPAGE") is a critical lesson. A dedicated pre-startup checklist after any extended stop must include a visual inspection of Tail Braker oil levels and a check for leaks around gearbox seals and couplings.
2. **Empower Operators:** Train operators to recognize and report leading indicators of failure, such as the "abnormal noise" (event 165) or the "more torque from last two bars" (event 164). This creates a human line of defense that can prevent a cobble.

**C. Engineering & Control System Upgrades**

1. **Implement Automated Diagnostic Alarms:** The PLC/control system can be programmed to automatically detect the two failure signatures described above.
    - **Stall/Jam Alarm:** `IF (MotorCurrent > 110% of nominal) AND (ActualSpeed << SpeedRef) THEN TRIGGER 'ALARM: POTENTIAL TAIL BRAKER JAM'`
    - **Decoupling/Loss of Load Alarm:** `IF (BrakingCycle = ACTIVE) AND (MotorCurrent < 20% of nominal) THEN TRIGGER 'ALARM: POTENTIAL COUPLING FAILURE'`
    This transforms the control system from a simple executor into a diagnostic tool.
2. **Improve Material Tracking Validation:** Enhance the logic to cross-validate the Tail Braker's reported speed with the actual time-of-flight of the bar between upstream HMDs and the Twin Channel entry HMDs. A significant discrepancy is a definitive sign of slippage or decoupling and should trigger an immediate system alarm or even a controlled stop.
